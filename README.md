# Vibe Template

**An AI-first Next.js template designed for agentic development with structured workflows and intelligent code assistance.**

## 🤖 Built for AI-Assisted Development

This template transforms how you build applications by providing AI agents with comprehensive rules, patterns, and workflows to deliver consistent, high-quality code assistance. Every aspect is designed to help AI understand your project structure and guide you through structured development.

### Key Features

- **🎯 6-Step Agentic Workflow**: From idea analysis to testing validation
- **📋 MVP-Focused Development**: Phase-based planning with clear milestones  
- **🔧 Intelligent Code Patterns**: Pre-configured rules for consistent development
- **📊 Progress Tracking**: Automated task management and git workflows
- **🚀 Production-Ready Stack**: Next.js + TypeScript + Supabase + Drizzle ORM

## Quick Start

1. **Clone and install:**
   ```bash
   git clone <this-repo>
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Set up your backend:**
   - Follow the **[Supabase Setup Guide](docs/supabase-setup.md)** for database configuration
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your credentials

3. **Start building:**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
   The AI agent will guide you through structured development from here.

## 🏗️ The Agentic Development Process

When you start a new feature or project, the AI agent follows a proven 6-step routine:

1. **💡 Idea Analysis** - Clarifies requirements and goals
2. **📋 MVP Planning** - Defines phases and core features  
3. **⚙️ Development Planning** - Creates detailed task lists
4. **🔨 Implementation** - Builds one feature at a time
5. **🧪 Testing & Validation** - Provides clear testing instructions
6. **📈 Progress Review** - Updates tracking and plans next steps

*See the complete process in [AI Agent Guide](docs/ai-agent-guide.md)*
